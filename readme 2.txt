The files contained in this project are as follows:

src_original -> The original code by djbarker

src_mod -> forked code updated by myself to run on 20x4 I2C LCD displays using the NewLiquidCrystal LCD Lib.
	   One is still set for 16x2 I2C, the other is marked for 20x4.

The mod folder also contains a modified Python script for the 20x4 display.
